These files use simulated data in R to give insight into common problems leading to lack of reproducibility, including p-hacking, failure to correct for multiple testing, and double-dipping.

They assume only limited knowledge of R by the user.

These exercises were first created for the BBSRC-STARS workshop on Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science at Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, UK on 7-12 April 2017.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.
